# Type Mismatch Bug in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript. The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but an array is passed to it, resulting in a type error.  The solution shows how to correctly handle the input to avoid the error.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.ts` in a TypeScript compiler.
3. Compile and run the code. You'll see a type error.
4. Look at `bugSolution.ts` for the solution.
